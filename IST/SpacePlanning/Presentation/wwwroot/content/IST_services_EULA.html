2 (&quot;License Types/Grants/Use&quot;). Licensee may physically transfer the
Software from one computer to another provided that Licensee does not retain
any copies of the Software in excess of the licenses purchased, including any
copies stored on a computer. Licensee may permanently transfer this license to
another user, but only if Licensee transfers or destroys all copies of the
Software, and the recipient agrees in writing to be bound by all of the terms
of this Agreement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(b) Licensee agrees that it will
not decompile, disassemble, or otherwise reverse engineer the Software, and
Licensee will use its best efforts to prevent Licensee’s employees and
contractors from doing so, except to the extent that such restriction is
expressly prohibited by applicable law. Licensee may not modify, adapt, create
a derivative work, merge, or translate the Software without the prior written
consent of IST. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>(c) Specific third-party
Suppliers may be identified in the Documentation which is sold or licensed by

created or used by the IST product is not permitted. </p>

copies of the Software for backup or archival purposes only, so long as IST’s
and its Suppliers’ copyright notices are reproduced on such copies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

the duration as stated in the Sales Agreement. This license automatically
terminates if Licensee fails to comply with any of the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. Licensee agrees that, upon such termination, Licensee will
either destroy (or permanently erase) all copies of the Software, or return the
original Software to IST. Licensee may terminate this license at any time by
destroying the Software and any permitted copies. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

that the original media and Documentation are free from defects in material and
workmanship under normal use for a period of time from the Licensee’s original
purchase date thereof (the “Limited Warranty Period”), provided the Software is
used in accordance with the Documentation and with compatible computer hardware
and operating systems. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The Limited
Warranty is ninety (90) calendar days.</b> This limited warranty is void if
failure of the Software has resulted from accident, abuse, or misapplication.
IST’s entire liability and Licensee’s sole and exclusive remedy shall be, at
IST’s option, either to (a) correct or help Licensee work around or avoid a
reproducible Error or (b) replace defective media or Documentation. An “Error”
is a defect in the Software that causes it not to perform substantially in
accordance with the limited warranty set forth above. Any replacement Software
will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period only. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS WITH LICENSEE.</i></b>
If a disclaimer of implied warranties is not permitted by law, the duration of
any such implied warranty is limited to the time period for the specific
Software product purchased, as stated in Section 6 above “Limited Warranty and
Limited Remedy” from the date of purchase by the original Licensee purchaser.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
limitations on how long an implied warranty may last, so such limitations or
exclusions may not apply to Licensee. This limited warranty gives Licensee
specific legal rights, and Licensee may also have other rights which vary from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction. </p>

inability to provide the limited remedies set forth above. Some jurisdictions
do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential

If the Software is acquired under the terms of a Department of Defense or
civilian agency contract, the Software is “commercial item” as that term is
defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer
software” and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are
used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations and its
successors and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202 -1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995) of the <span

end users acquire the Software with only those rights set forth in this

Restrictions.</b> The U.S. Government maintains certain embargoes and

Persons List located at <a href="http://www.bis.doc.gov/dpl/default.shtm">http://www.bis.doc.gov/dpl/default.shtm</a>.
Neither IST or Licensee shall export, directly or indirectly, any information
acquired under this Agreement or any products utilizing any such information to
any country for which the U.S. Government or any agency thereof at the time of
export requires an export license or other government approval without first
obtaining such United States and foreign government license or approval. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>12. Severability</b>. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that each
provision of this Agreement that provides for a disclaimer of warranties or an
exclusion or limitation of damages represents an express allocation of risk,
and is part of the consideration of this Agreement. Invalidity of any provision
of this Agreement shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>13. Audit Rights.</b> IST, or a IST designated agent, (the “Auditor”)
may upon thirty (30) business days written notice to Licensee, inspect any of
Licensee’s facilities where the Software is used and audit records for the
purpose of confirming Licensee’s compliance with the exercise of the licenses
granted in Section 2 “License Types/Grants/Use”. All such audits will be
conducted during reasonable business hours and in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with Licensee’s business activities. The audit shall be
performed at IST’s sole expense; provided however, that if, as a result of the
IST audit, it is determined that Licensee is out of compliance by five percent
(10%) of Licenses Granted and that Licensee owes IST additional fees, then
Licensee shall bear the reasonable cost of IST’s audit and pay all past-due
fees, in addition to such other remedies as IST may have under the terms and
conditions between Licensee and IST. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

third parties, corrective and preventative technical support services under the
terms of this Agreement. Licensee expressly consents to the provision and
collection of certain Licensee information and data in connection with the
services. The personal information IST collects will be used by IST, and its
third party suppliers, to 1) provide the technical support service(s) or the
transaction(s) Licensee has requested or authorized; 2) be used to request
additional information on feedback that Licensee provides about the product or
service that Licensee is using; 3) to provide critical updates and
notifications regarding the pre-release software; or 4) to improve the product
or service, i.e. fixing reported product issues. Licensee expressly consents to
IST permitting certain third parties and consultants that it retains to perform
services on its behalf to access Licensee’s information and data solely to
perform the services for Licensee. The Licensee is responsible for providing
any required notices and/or obtaining any required consents relating to
collection and use of such data (including any such consent necessary for IST
to provide these services). The Licensee is responsible for taking the steps
necessary to ensure that the Licensee’s use of the services complies with
applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice. </p>

modified only by a writing executed by an authorized representative of IST. No
IST dealer or sales representative is authorized to make any modifications,
extensions or additions to this Agreement. This Agreement is governed by the
